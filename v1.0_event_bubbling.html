//What is Event Bubbling?
  //It's the event bubbling up through the DOM tree
//It always occurs, for example, when you add a 'click' eventListner. The event originates at a certain element, and bubbles up to the parent element, the li, then to the ul, all the way up to the furthermost element. 
  //If there are eventListeners added to those parentElements, then those will fire off too

//DELETE BOOKS
const list = document.querySelector('#book-list ul'); 

list.addEventListener('click', function(e){
if (e.target.className == 'delete'){
    const li = e.target.parentElement; 
    list.removeChild(li);
}

})

//We have an eventListener associated with the Ul. When we click on the Ul, we make sure we are clicking on a button. If we are clicking on a button, then we are running the code in line 13. We get the Li associated with it and remove the Li.
