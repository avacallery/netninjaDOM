//What is Event Bubbling?
  //It's the event bubbling up through the DOM tree
//It always occurs, for example, when you add a 'click' eventListner. The event originates at a certain element, and bubbles up to the parent element, the li, then to the ul, all the way up to the furthermost element. 
  //If there are eventListeners added to those parentElements, then those will fire off too
