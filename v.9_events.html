<!--Adding eventlisteners-->

var h2 = document.querySelector('#book-list h2')

h2.addEventListner('click', function(event){
console.log(event.target); 
console.log(event);
});

<!--Two paramenters: the 'click' event, 
and a callback function, or whats going to fire when this event happens on a page

when someone clicks on the h2 element, addEventListener will be listening to the clicks, and function will pass whatever is passed through the (e) or event parameter

event.target; 
.target is a property on the event object, this will tell us what element was clicked, or what is the target of the event
